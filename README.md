Employees and Employers database C++
Hi all!

I would like to work as programmer. I am interested in embedded systems. I also like making Android applications (I made only one but it was very fun).

This project is designed for my learn C++ and object oriented programming. It is something like database - user can add and delete employees (dynamic objects) and save base to .csv file. Of course, user can load previously saved data. 

I hope you enjoy it!
Thanks for any advance - this is my first bigger program.
