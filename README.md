Employees and Employers database C++
Hi all!

I would like to work as programmer. I am interested in embedded systems. I also like making Android apllications (I made only one).

This project is designed for my work C++ and objected programming. It is something like database - user can add and delete employees (dynamic objects) and save base to .csv file. Of course, user can load previously saved data. 

I hope you enjoy it
Thanks for any advance
